# HTML Hands-on Repository  

This repository contains the source code for the HTML hands-on tutorials that I have performed. Each source code file is uploaded as:  

- `index-v1.html`  
- `index-v2.html`  
- `index-v3.html`  
- ...  

Here, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, etc., indicate different days of the tutorial.  

## Documentation  

For each `.html` file, a corresponding `.md` file is created. These Markdown files contain:  

- **Explanations** of the concepts covered.  
- **Screenshots** of the executed commands and their outputs.  

This structure ensures that each tutorial step is well-documented for future reference.
